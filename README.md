# Final-Project
Our project is a more visual RPG, using Processing. It's RPGs such that there is a character traveling and fighting other characters and bosses. The map is going to be horizontal and the character is going to travel to one end and as he travels he could meet monsters and bossexs that he chooses to fight. The fight scene would be at a different frame. There are items to collect to help aid in the fight. To the next level, it would be another floor, with different characters to fight. There is a life system. 
To play, the player would first build his character and then begin his journey. 

LOG:

Tuesday, January 6: We decided on how our game really works. There will be a start screen where the user can pick between two characters to ultimately travel through levels as he/she fights different characters. The idea is to also have items/coins to pick up for more points/ease in killing the opponent. 

Wednesday, January 7: Today, we downloaded Processing and spent a good amount of time looking at the differences in code between Java and Processing. There was some trouble in downloading Processing while in school, but it was easily fixed at home. 

Thursday, January 8: Yesterday, we spent more time reading through Processing tutorials and looked for different characters and background sprites to add onto our game. 

Friday, January 9: Today, we started offically coding the setup and background. 

Sunday, January 11: Today, the background and character sprite was added. The background moves witht the character with some glitches. Have to figure that out. 

Monday, January 12: The glitch in the background skip was fixed. The background was changed. New characters are to be added. We also made sure that Labidia's git shell worked flawflessly, which it did. The character is now set in the middle of the screen, boundaries not needed. Jump directly up added. Also split the code into different clases. Items and monsters are to be made. 

Tuesday, January 13: The sprits of the monsters were cropped. Monster class was too be done. Menu screen planned for tonight. 

Wednesday, January 14: The monster class is up and running and is matched with the position variable so that it moves towards the character. But the same character at every loop? lame... need to randomize monster appearances. Need to create a contact class - to start a new frame/fight. The start menu works and button class is now readily avilable. HP and items are needed to be created. Jump up will be utlizied to collect hp coins and items. (see if there's a jump twice - double the height?)
