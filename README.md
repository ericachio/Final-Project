# Final-Project
Our project is a more visual RPG, using Processing. It's RPGs such that there is a character traveling and fighting other characters and bosses. The map is going to be horizontal and the character is going to travel to one end and as he travels he could meet monsters and bossexs that he chooses to fight. The fight scene would be at a different frame. There are items to collect to help aid in the fight. To the next level, it would be another floor, with different characters to fight. There is a life system. 
To play, the player would first build his character and then begin his journey. 

LOG:

Tuesday, January 6: We decided on how our game really works. There will be a start screen where the user can pick between two characters to ultimately travel through levels as he/she fights different characters. The idea is to also have items/coins to pick up for more points/ease in killing the opponent. 

Wednesday, January 7: Today, we downloaded Processing and spent a good amount of time looking at the differences in code between Java and Processing. There was some trouble in downloading Processing while in school, but it was easily fixed at home. 

Thursday, January 8: Yesterday, we spent more time reading through Processing tutorials and looked for different characters and background sprites to add onto our game. 

Friday, January 9: Today, we started offically coding the setup and background. 

Sunday, January 11: Today, the background and character sprite was added. The background moves witht the character with some glitches. Have to figure that out.
