# Final-Project
Our project is a more visual RPG, using Processing. It's RPGs such that there is a character traveling and fighting other characters and bosses. The map is going to be horizontal and the character is going to travel to one end and as he travels he could meet monsters and bossexs that he chooses to fight. The fight scene would be at a different frame. There are items to collect to help aid in the fight. To the next level, it would be another floor, with different characters to fight. There is a life system. 
To play, the player would first build his character and then begin his journey. 

LOG:

Tuesday, January 6: We decided on how our game really works. There will be a start screen where the user can pick between two characters to ultimately travel through levels as he/she fights different characters. The idea is to also have items/coins to pick up for more points/ease in killing the opponent. 

Wednesday, January 7: Today, we downloaded Processing and spent a good amount of time looking at the differences in code between Java and Processing. There was some trouble in downloading Processing while in school, but it was easily fixed at home. 

Thursday, January 8: Yesterday, we spent more time reading through Processing tutorials and looked for different characters and background sprites to add onto our game. 

Friday, January 9: Today, we started offically coding the setup and background. 

Sunday, January 11: Today, the background and character sprite was added. The background moves witht the character with some glitches. Have to figure that out. 

Monday, January 12: The glitch in the background skip was fixed. The background was changed. New characters are to be added. We also made sure that Labidia's git shell worked flawflessly, which it did. The character is now set in the middle of the screen, boundaries not needed. Jump directly up added. Also split the code into different clases. Items and monsters are to be made. 

Tuesday, January 13: The sprits of the monsters were cropped. Monster class was too be done. Menu screen planned for tonight. 

Wednesday, January 14: The monster class is up and running and is matched with the position variable so that it moves towards the character. But the same character at every loop? lame... need to randomize monster appearances. Need to create a contact class - to start a new frame/fight. The start menu works and button class is now readily avilable. HP and items are needed to be created. Jump up will be utlizied to collect hp coins and items. (see if there's a jump twice - double the height?)

Thursday, January 15: The encounter with monsters now lead to a new battle screen with the button start. There is to be a menu in which the player can choose to attack. Perhaps a sprite with fighting for the characters needs to be found? 

Friday, January 16: The battle screen contains option to attack, which does so arbitrarily, which will be fixed. Attack sprites are added and hp and skill set added too. 

Saturday, January 17: The game works. The attack button works. The monsters change afer each attack. To do: randomize the appearance of monsters. Add items. Create a game over screen, if player has no more HP. See if the attack animations can be more delayed and played out. . . 

Sunday, January 18: The levels are added up to 5. Randomized appearance of monsters. Game over screen. To Do: items/replenish HP, mana, special attacks. 

Sunday, January 18: Made each monster a separate level and made the level update.Made a specific order for the monsters instead of making it random (making it random lead to the same monster repeating throughout the game). added monsters for level 4 and 5 because they didn't show up when i tested it. Also fixed the code so that the end screen showed up in the end because it didn't when i tested it. 

Monday, January 19: Added a special attack button that works once the monster the player is facing has half of its life left. With special attack the player can kill the monster with one click. Tried to add a restart button. Although it brings back the start screen, if you try to choose a player, it doesn't work correctly.

Tuesday, January 20: Added instructions at the beginning of the game. Added a health reward at the beginning of level 3. I just attempted to add animation for specialattack and add a restart button for the past 4 hours. I ended up erasing all the restart stuff for the final version for tonight because I don't want anything faulty to be in the game.

The game works and runs smoothly.
