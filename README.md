# Final-Project
Our project is a more visual RPG, using Processing. It's RPGs such that there is a character traveling and fighting other characters and bosses. The map is going to be horizontal and the character is going to travel to one end and as he travels he could meet monsters and bossexs that he chooses to fight. The fight scene would be at a different frame. There are items to collect to help aid in the fight. To the next level, it would be another floor, with different characters to fight. There is a life system. 
To play, the player would first build his character and then begin his journey.
